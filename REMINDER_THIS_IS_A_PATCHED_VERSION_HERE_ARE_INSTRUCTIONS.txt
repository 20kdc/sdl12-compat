this is a patched personal fork of sdl12-compat

the fork: https://github.com/20kdc/sdl12-compat
original upstream code: https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat

reminder: no warranty is provided, implied or otherwise

binaries are only released due to interest overlapping with c3ds-projects

Linux binaries would be provided, but I'd need to fix stuff like "dlclose@GLIBC_2.34"

Linux .sh:

export SDL12COMPAT_SCALE_SHADER=shaders/crt.glsl

Windows .bat:

set SDL12COMPAT_SCALE_SHADER=shaders/crt.glsl

check console for errors
